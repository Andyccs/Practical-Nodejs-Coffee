Chapter 2: Test-driven Development for Blog Project
===================================================

I will develop exactly the same blog project in the book, but using a different approach and language. The book does provide a guideline on how to do test-driven development in Nodejs, but does not use this approach intensively. For example, we only have 3 tests at the end of chapter 5.
