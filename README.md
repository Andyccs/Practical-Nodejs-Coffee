# Practical-Nodejs-Coffee

I feel bad when I read and follow Node.js guide by Azat. Hence, I create this repo and I will focus on the following topics:

1. Test-driven development
2. Coffee Script

# Assumptions

I assume that you already:

1. Read the Book [Practical Nodejs](https://github.com/azat-co/practicalnode) by Azat
